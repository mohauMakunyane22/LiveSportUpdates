title: Project Management Methodology
description: How we plan, track, and execute our work using Agile practices

## Development Approach

We follow an Agile methodology with **2-week sprints** focused on iteration, collaboration, and continuous feedback. The goal is to deliver usable features regularly while allowing for flexibility in planning.

## Tools Used

- **Notion** — Our central hub for sprint boards, backlog tracking, task assignments, and documentation.
- **Discord** — Used for team communication, async updates, and coordination with tutors and other stakeholders.

## Workflow Structure

### Sprint Length

- Each sprint runs for **2 weeks**.

### Planning and Meetings

| Meeting              | Frequency            | Format               | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Sprint Planning**  | Every second Tuesday | In-person            | Plan the upcoming sprint, estimate tasks |
| **Sprint Check-ins** | 3 times per week     | Discord              | Review progress, unblock teammates       |
| **Sprint Review**    | Every Friday         | In-person or Discord | Demo progress, gather feedback           |

### Issue Lifecycle

Tasks are managed within Notion boards and typically move through these phases:

- `Backlog` → `To Do` → `In Progress` → `Review` → `Done`

Each task includes:

- A short spec or description
- Acceptance criteria (if needed)
- Assignee(s) and estimated effort

## Communication

Team communication is async-first using Discord. Urgent issues or blockers are flagged in the project channel. Tutors are also reachable via Discord for technical support and feedback during the sprint cycle.

## Retrospectives

Retrospectives are currently informal but planned for future sprints to gather feedback, identify blockers, and improve processes.
